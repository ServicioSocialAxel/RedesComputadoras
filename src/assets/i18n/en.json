This DDR was developed with the purpose of promoting autonomous learning, as well as facilitating, enriching, and strengthening the teaching-learning processes of the LU in question in the traditional (in-person) modality. The learning unit contributes to the graduate profile of Computer Systems Engineering by developing skills in analyzing the functions of the Open Systems Interconnection reference model and the TCP/IP protocol stack, designing logical and physical topologies of a local area network according to EIA/TIA/ANSI standards, and configuring routing algorithms. Additionally, it fosters teamwork, leadership, and decision-making.",
